Here i am creating a model of linear regression from scratch.
I am not using any library to train the model.
Only matplotlib library is used to visualize the data.
I am training the model by Stochastic Gradient Descent
Stochastic gradient descent (often shortened to SGD), also known as incremental gradient descent, is an iterative method for optimizing a differentiable objective function, a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization. In SGD we update the parameters at every point where as in Batch Gradient Descent we update the parameters in batch means after adding the loss at all point's. We will discuss later about Batch Gradient Descent.
